/*Lecture No.4 (LET CONST VAR)
Creating a variable means a creation of space in the memory where we may store some data. In this we create variable and then store data in it. 

i.	Const accountID = 123456 {Its value cannot be changed once assigned. Recommended for use while programming}

ii.	Let accountEmail = faizahemed@avc.com {Its value may also be changed when required. Recommended for use while programming.}

iii.	Var accountPassword = “222222” {Its values changed but not recommended due to block scope and functional scope.}

iv.	Cityname = “Rawalpindi” {Its also not recommended. But we may also change value in it.}

 We may also create a variable without assigning value to it like.

v.	Let statename;

Its output should be undefined when we print it on screen.
